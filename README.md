# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

This analysis is to review and compare Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program to unpaid reviews.  The dataset for baby products was chosen for analysis.  A comparison of the percentage of five star reviews is used a basis in determining if there is a positivity bias for the paid versus unpaid reviews.   

## Results

The original dataset was filtered to only include products with at least 20 reviews and where the reviews were voted 'helpful' by the majority (>50%) of total votes.  

### Summary of Analyzed DataSet

## Summary

Based on the total percentage of five-star reviews there does not appear to be a positivity biased for the vine program reviews.   Additional analysis to determine positivity bias would be to lower the rating threshold from five stars to four stars and see if there is any signifcant difference in the results.
